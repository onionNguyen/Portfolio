### Internship at National Circuit Assembly

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

I completed a four-month internship at National Circuit Assembly, a company that provides electronic manufacturing services. During my internship, I worked on the following tasks:

- Supported the application development of an operational workflow management tool for workers in a factory that produced electrical
boards to increase operational efficiency by 40%, by redesigning the user interface using Bootstrap and Visual Studio Code, and improving
the algorithm logic using PHP Laravel, MySQL Workbench and Data Tables.
- Coded on CSS and JavaScript prioritized user stories to develop new functionality and capabilities for a variety of front and back-end product
releases to increase technical performance and user experience through developing in an Agile DevOps process.
- Created a workflow to identify, report, fix, and test bugs on the Product Web Application, including redundant or ineffective features, leading
to fixing 15+ critical bugs over four months through collaboration with two engineers for issues on CSS and JavaScript.

Through this internship, I gained valuable skills and experience in web development, database management, and teamwork. I learned how to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world problems and meet customer needs. I also enjoyed working with a supportive and talented team that helped me grow as a developer. This internship was a rewarding and enriching opportunity that prepared me for my future career goals.
