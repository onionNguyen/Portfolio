To do List is a simple and elegant app that helps you organize your tasks and projects. 
You can create tasks with date and timer, mark them as done or delete them, and view them in a list or a calendar.
You can also edit your tasks, add notes, set reminders, and prioritize them.

To do List is built with Flutter, a cross-platform UI toolkit that allows you to build beautiful, natively compiled apps from a single codebase. Whether you need to manage your personal or professional life, To do List can help you stay on track and achieve your goals. To do List is still in development and more features will be added soon, such as syncing your tasks across devices, sharing your tasks with others, and adding subtasks and categories. Stay tuned for updates and feedback!
