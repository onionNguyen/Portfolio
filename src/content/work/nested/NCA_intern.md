### Internship at National Circuit Assembly

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.

I completed a four-month internship at National Circuit Assembly, a company that provides electronic manufacturing services. During my internship, I worked on the following tasks:

- Contributed to the redesign of the company's product application using various technologies such as Visual Studio Code, Github, PHP Laravel, Bootstrap, MySQL Workbench, and Data Tables. I redesigned the application UI to a whole new one that was more modern, user-friendly, and consistent with the company's branding.
- Added new functions to different processes to improve overall performance and user experience. For example, I implemented a search feature that allowed users to filter and sort the products by various criteria, such as name, category, price, and availability.
- Troubleshot and fixed existing functions and deleted ineffective or redundant features. I debugged and resolved issues such as broken links, incorrect data, and slow loading times. I also removed unnecessary or outdated code and files to optimize the application's speed and security.
- Collaborated with the development team to ensure the successful and timely completion of projects. I communicated regularly with the team members and the project manager using tools such as Slack, Zoom, and Trello. I also followed the agile methodology and participated in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and code reviews.
- Used CSS and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. I applied best practices and standards for web design and development, such as using semantic HTML elements, modular CSS classes, and reusable JavaScript functions. I also ensured that the application was compatible with different browsers and devices.

Through this internship, I gained valuable skills and experience in web development, database management, and teamwork. I learned how to apply my knowledge and creativity to solve real-world problems and meet customer needs. I also enjoyed working with a supportive and talented team that helped me grow as a developer. This internship was a rewarding and enriching opportunity that prepared me for my future career goals.
