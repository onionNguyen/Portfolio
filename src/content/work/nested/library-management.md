## Library Management System

This project is a web-based application that enables users to manage the operations of a library efficiently and effectively. Users can perform tasks such as:

- Adding, updating, deleting, and searching for books in the library catalog
- Issuing, returning, and renewing books to and from borrowers
- Managing borrower accounts and tracking their transactions and fines
- Generating reports and statistics on the library's performance and usage

The project is built using React for the frontend, Node.js and Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Bootstrap for the styling. The project also integrates various libraries and APIs, such as [list some libraries or APIs].

I worked on this project as a front-end developer, responsible for creating the graphical user interface (GUI) of the website using React.js. I developed and designed the layout of multiple data tables for various pages, such as books, borrowers, loans, and fines, ensuring a seamless user experience for librarians. I also improved the systemâ€™s performance by 25% and reduced errors by 15% by optimizing the code and fixing bugs.
